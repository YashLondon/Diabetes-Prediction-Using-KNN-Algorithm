Project Description
The Diabetes Prediction Using KNN Algorithm project is designed to assist in predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using a machine learning model based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Diabetes is a prevalent health issue globally, and early detection can help in effective management and treatment. This project leverages medical data, including patient attributes such as age, glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure, to predict the probability of diabetes.

The project is structured as an interactive Jupyter Notebook, providing an accessible platform for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. By analyzing patterns and relationships within the data, the KNN model provides insights that can be useful for educational purposes, healthcare practitioners, and those interested in machine learning applications in healthcare. This project also serves as a foundational example for beginners to understand how machine learning techniques can be applied to solve real-world problems.

Features
This project includes several key features that make it both functional and user-friendly:

Comprehensive Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and prepare the data for training. This ensures optimal performance of the KNN algorithm.

KNN Algorithm Implementation: The core machine learning algorithm, KNN, is implemented using Scikit-learn. This allows users to easily modify hyperparameters such as the number of neighbors and distance metrics to observe their impact on the model's performance.

Evaluation Metrics: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive view of its performance. Visualizations are also included to better understand the results.

Interactive Workflow: The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it highly interactive. Users can follow step-by-step instructions to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results, fostering learning and experimentation.

Customizable Parameters: Users can easily tweak hyperparameters and preprocess options to test how changes affect predictions and accuracy.

Clear and Modular Codebase: The code is organized into clear and reusable modules, ensuring readability and ease of use for developers and researchers.
