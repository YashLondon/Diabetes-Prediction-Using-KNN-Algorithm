KNN algorithm for diabetes prediction

## Usage

To run the code YashAIcode1.ipynb, you'll need to set up your Kaggle API credentials:

1. Visit the Kaggle website and log in to your Kaggle account.
2. Go to your Kaggle account settings: https://www.kaggle.com/account
3. Scroll down to the "API" section and click "Create New API Token." This will download a file called `kaggle.json`.
4. Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in the `~/.kaggle/` directory (on Linux/macOS) or `C:\Users\<your_username>\.kaggle\` (on Windows).

Once your Kaggle API credentials are set up, you can run the code by executing it.
I have also included my own file kaggle.json.
